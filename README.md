Project repo for Chaos Castle, a co-op game for Android (and iOS).


## Git Usage

Create a new branch for each coding task, and name the branch \[netId\]\_\[codingTask\].

When you're done with your coding task, submit a **pull request**. We'll merge our changes to the master branch during coding meetings or after class.

Write commit messages **in the imperative** and keep them under 80 characters. Ex. `git commit -m "add art assets for castle"` `git commit -m "implement basic networking"`


## Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)

This template provides a base for you to build off of.  You should add all of your
files to sources and assets, as appropriate.  This will allow access to the Apple,
Android, and Windows IDEs.

You will need to make changes to the project to give it a different name and package
identifier (to prevent your application from clashing with others).  See the course 
web page for instructions
